# abc123

This is aught but a small DIY/autodidactical script/app. The problem I
want to solve is that a small jam session keeps an abc file (think tex
for music, kind of) with all of the songs that have been played by the
group in the last few years. There is also a weekly update that lists
which songs were played that week. It would be nice to take the songs
from the master list and generate a smaller file for only the recently
used songs to help focus the practice. The practical upshot is that
this keeps songs played as part of a set next to each other in the
final score.
